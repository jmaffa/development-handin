                To learn the fundamentals of programming with React, I created a list aggregation system. 
                After running a competitive analysis on a few websites that offer similar services, I aimed to prioritize X Y and Z in my interface.
                I then developed an interface that could be used to appoint people to songs in my drumming group, Gendo Taiko. I then deployed the React application using Vercel.

                I began by conducting a competitive analysis on other list aggregation tools in order to compare useful features. 
                Specifically I compared list aggregators in different domains: playlist making (spotify.com), team building (craftednba.com), and clothing shopping (abercrombie.com).
                The team building website is the most similar to my project, but I wanted to see what features I could borrow from the other two domains as well.

                TODO: add features from class?
                In my competitive analysis, I compared features that expedite and simplify the user experience. For example, I found that sites like CraftedNBA with a lot of cards on one page and no sort or
                filter features was extremely overwhelming. However, it benefitted by having a visible list on the page, allowing me to track what I was adding to my "favorites" list as I used the app without needing
                me to navigate to another page like with Spotify's Liked Songs or Abercrombie's Favorited feature. However, I found that Spotify and Abercrombie benefitted from having informative cards with information
                that may be used to sort/filter the cards and help the user make a decision on what to add to the table. Finally, I think that having a clearly visible add to list button made
                a big difference in expediting the user experience and reducing the scanning a user has to do to get the desired goal of adding the item to the list.
            </p>

            <p>
                From this competitive analysis, I chose to prioritize having informative cards, clear add and removal buttons, and a clearly visible list in my interface along with the required features of sorting and filtering based on information
                that is visible in the cards.

            <p>
                For my list aggregation system, I developed a website that can be used to allocate people to songs. In my drumming ensemble, Gendo Taiko,
                we often struggle to determine who can be put in what song for each performance. This system allows users to filter members based on their
                time in the club (gen), and the songs that they know. When the user picks a song, they will be left with only the members who can play that song.
                The user can then add and remove members from that song. If they'd like to sort all the possible members based on graduation year, gen, or name, they also
                have the option to do that.

                Overall this was a great project to learn some of the fundamentals of state management in React. I was able to conduct research of similar systems and pick
                the best features to implement in my own project. In creating my application, I learned how to design using a component system and manage passing props up
                and down the component tree. Finally, I also gained experience deploying a React application using Vercel.
